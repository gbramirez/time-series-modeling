# time-series-modeling 
<p>A time-series modeling project to forecast quarterly revenue.</p>
<p>The project was made in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python.</p>

## Business Question
<p>Using time series modeling techniques, can the first two years of a company's revenue data be used to forecast the next quarter's revenue?</p>

## Goals
<ul>
    <li>Identify trends in the first two years of revenue data</li>
    <li>Use the insight to build a predictive model</li>
    <li>Use the model to forecast the next quarter's revenue</li>
</ul>

## Assumptions
### Stationarity Data
<p>Stationary Data is a core assumption of a Time Series model. According to <em>Practical Time Series Analysis</em>, a Time Series analysis requires "that the internal structures of the series do not change over time" (Pal & Prakash, 2017). A lack of stationarity data would prevent the analysis from rendering a valid forecast.</p>

### Auto-correlated Data
<p>Time Series is unique in that it assumes one data point is dependent on another. According to <em>Autocorrelation in Time Series Data</em>, Time Series analysis "often displays serial dependence" in which "the value of a datapoint at one time is statistically dependent on another datapoint in another time"(Dotis-Georgiou, 2019). The assumption is unique because many forms of analysis assume data is statistically independent.</p>
